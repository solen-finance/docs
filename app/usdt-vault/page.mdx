# USDT Vault – EDUChain

## Overview

The **USDT Vault** is the first product from Solen on EDUChain — a simple, real yield vault that converts USDT into OCUSD, a yield-bearing stablecoin. OCUSD is staked into a vault that earns passive returns from external strategies like **USDX** on Arbitrum.

This document covers how it works, how to earn, and what to expect.

---

## Key Components

### OCUSD – Yield-Bearing Stablecoin

- Minted 1:1 with USDT (minus a small minting fee)
- Grows in value over time via rising share price (non-rebasing)
- Backed by off-chain and L2 yield strategies

### sOCUSD – Staking Vault Token

- Stake OCUSD to receive sOCUSD (ERC4626 vault shares)
- Yield accrues as the share price of sOCUSD increases
- Withdrawals follow an epoch-based system

### Yield Source: USDX

- Bridged USDT is deposited into **USDX** (Arbitrum-based stablecoin strategy)
- Yield is streamed back to EDUChain manually
- Rewards compound back into the vault for stakers

---

## Getting Started

1. **Deposit USDT** via Solen frontend (Arbitrum or EDUChain)
2. **Mint OCUSD** (1:1 ratio with minting fee)
3. **Stake OCUSD** to receive sOCUSD
4. **Yield accrues** automatically
5. **Request unstake** (starts cooldown)
6. **Claim OCUSD** after cooldown completes
7. **Redeem OCUSD for USDT** (only on EDUChain)

## Withdrawals & Epoch Timing

Withdrawals follow an **epoch-based schedule**, with timing aligned to the external strategy’s unlock periods.

| Step                | Detail                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Cooldown Period     | Epoch-based (typically 7–15 days)      |
| Claim Process       | Users must call `unstake()`, wait, then call `claim()` |
| Redemption          | Available only on EDUChain             |
| Coordination        | Batched by Solen team in sync with strategy cycles |

Users will see **clear instructions in the frontend** on when to unstake and when to come back to claim.

## Safety & Admin

- Multisig-controlled bridging and strategy operations
- `REWARDER_ROLE` governs reward streaming
- Emergency pause via `PAUSER_ROLE`

---

## Vault Roadmap

### Launch

- USDT → OCUSD → sOCUSD
- Yield via USDX (Arbitrum)
- Manual yield streaming to EDUChain

### Upcoming

- USDC minting support
- Strategy rotation tooling
- Public vault dashboard with APY, NAV, and analytics

---

## Strategy Operations

Solen vault strategies run on a **weekly operational cycle** to handle bridging, staking, and reward harvesting.

While **user deposits and yield accrual happen continuously**, underlying strategy movements are executed in defined epochs.

---

## Deposit Flow (Users)

- Deposit USDT anytime
- Instantly receive OCUSD
- Start earning yield immediately
- Minting fee applies to reduce drag and smooth out strategy latency

---

## Deposit Flow (Ops Team)

- **Epoch Day (T0):**
  1. Bridge USDT to Arbitrum
  2. Mint USDX
  3. Stake into sUSDX

---

## Redemption Flow (Users)

Withdrawals are tied to the cooldown/redemption cycle of the underlying strategy.

- Users initiate a **redemption request** via `unstake()`
- After the epoch ends, users must **call `claim()`** to retrieve OCUSD
- OCUSD can then be redeemed for USDT on EDUChain

All steps will be clearly shown in the UI.

---

## Redemption Flow (Ops Team)

- **T0:** Unstake sUSDX (start cooldown)
- **T+1:** Claim USDX (start USDX cooldown)
- **T+8:** Redeem USDX → Receive USDT → Bridge back

## Example: Max Redemption Timeline

| Step              | Day    | Action                                  |
|-------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| Missed Epoch      | T0 + 1 | User initiates after ops epoch closes   |
| Next Inclusion    | T+7    | Included in next batch                   |
| USDX Cooldown     | T+8    | Begin 7-day unstake period               |
| Final Return      | T+15   | USDT arrives back on EDUChain            |

**Maximum wait time: 15 days**

## Historical Yields

- USDX strategies have historically generated **7–10% APY**
