# USDT Vault – EDUChain

## Overview

The **USDT Vault** is the first product from Solen on EDUChain — a simple, real yield vault that converts USDT into **OCUSD**, a yield-bearing stablecoin. OCUSD earns passive returns from external strategies like **USDX** on Arbitrum.

This document explains how the vault works, how to earn yield, and what to expect during withdrawals.

---

## Key Components

### OCUSD – Yield-Bearing Stablecoin

- Minted with USDT (minus any minting fee)
- Grows in value over time via rising share price (non-rebasing)
- Backed by off-chain and L2 yield strategies (e.g. USDX)
- Yield accrues automatically — no staking required

### Yield Source: USDX

- Bridged USDT is deposited into **USDX** on Arbitrum
- Yield is streamed back to EDUChain manually
- Rewards are compounded into the vault to grow OCUSD share price

---

## Getting Started

1. **Deposit USDT** on Arbitrum or EDUChain
2. **Mint OCUSD** (you receive OCUSD at current share price, any minting fee)
3. **Hold OCUSD** — yield accrues automatically
4. **Request withdrawal** (initiates cooldown)
5. **Claim USDT** after the cooldown ends (on EDUChain)

## Withdrawals & Epoch Timing

Withdrawals are processed on an **epoch-based schedule**, aligned with the underlying strategy's unlock periods.

| Step                | Detail                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Cooldown Period     | Epoch-based (typically 7–15 days)      |
| Claim Process       | Call `requestWithdraw()`, then `claim()` later |
| Redemption Location | USDT claims only supported on EDUChain |
| Ops Coordination    | Handled by Solen team per strategy epoch |

## Safety & Admin

- Multisig-controlled bridging and strategy operations
- `REWARDER_ROLE` governs reward streaming
- Emergency pause via `PAUSER_ROLE`

---

## Vault Roadmap

### Launch

- USDT → OCUSD minting
- Yield via USDX (Arbitrum)
- Manual yield streaming to EDUChain

### Upcoming

- USDC minting support
- Strategy rotation tooling
- Public vault dashboard with APY, NAV, and analytics

---

## Strategy Operations

Solen vault strategies run on a **weekly operational cycle** to handle bridging, staking, and reward harvesting.

While **user deposits and yield accrual happen continuously**, underlying strategy movements occur in discrete epochs.

---

## Deposit Flow (Users)

- Deposit USDT via Solen frontend
- Receive OCUSD at current share price, minus any minting fee
- Start earning yield automatically

---

## Deposit Flow (Ops Team)

- **Epoch Day (T0):**
  1. Bridge USDT to Arbitrum
  2. Mint USDX
  3. Stake into sUSDX (USDX staking pool)

---

## Redemption Flow (Users)

- Call `requestWithdraw()` to begin redemption
- After the epoch ends, call `claim()` to receive USDT
- Claiming is only available on EDUChain

---

## Redemption Flow (Ops Team)

- **T0:** Unstake sUSDX (start cooldown)
- **T+1:** Claim USDX (start USDX cooldown)
- **T+8:** Redeem USDX → Receive USDT → Bridge back

## Example: Max Redemption Timeline

| Step              | Day    | Action                                  |
|-------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| Missed Epoch      | T0 + 1 | User initiates after ops epoch closes   |
| Next Inclusion    | T+7    | Included in next batch                   |
| USDX Cooldown     | T+8    | Begin 7-day unstake period               |
| Final Return      | T+15   | USDT arrives back on EDUChain            |

**Maximum wait time: ~15 days**

## Historical Yields

- USDX strategies have historically generated **7–10% APY**
