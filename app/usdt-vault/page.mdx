# USDT Vault – EDUChain

## Overview

The **USDT Vault** is a passive yield product by Solen Finance on EDUChain. Users deposit USDT and receive **OCUSD**, a yield-bearing stablecoin that appreciates over time based on real stablecoin yield strategies. All operations are handled by the Solen team, and users earn without needing to manage strategies themselves.

---

## How It Works

1. **Deposit USDT on EDUChain**
   - Users deposit USDT into the vault via the Solen frontend.
   - In return, they receive OCUSD, a token that represents their share in the vault.

2. **Yield Strategies Managed by Solen**
   - Solen deploys the USDT into stablecoin yield strategies on Arbitrum One.
   - Yield is harvested and bridged back to EDUChain to grow OCUSD value.

3. **Automatic Yield Accrual**
   - OCUSD is non-rebasing and increases in value over time.
   - No need to stake or claim — holding OCUSD is enough.

4. **Redemption Process**
   - Users initiate a cooldown via `requestWithdraw()`.
   - After the cooldown period (default 15 days), they can claim USDT on EDUChain.

## Risks

All vaults carry inherent risks. Key risks include:

- **Smart Contract Risk**: Bugs or exploits in Solen or third-party contracts.
- **Multisig Risk**: Assets are managed via a Solen-controlled multisig.
- **Strategy Risk**: Involves exposure to third-party protocols with potential for depeg, slippage, or insolvency.

Solen’s contracts have been audited by **Certik**, but audits do not eliminate all risk.
