# About Solen

**Solen** is a yield-focused DeFi vault protocol built for **EDU Chain**, starting with stablecoin staking and expanding toward a modular suite of vaults that target the best on-chain yield opportunities.

The protocol’s core product is **OCUSD**, a yield-bearing stablecoin backed by strategies like staking USDT into USDX. Users mint OCUSD and earn real yield automatically.

But that’s just the beginning.

## The Bigger Vision

Solen aims to be the **go-to vault layer** for EDU Chain — helping users access the best yield opportunities without complexity. Every **Solen Vault** is a strategy: it could be a stablecoin staking route, a validator strategy, or even a Blend-style leveraged position.

Future vaults may include:

- ETH-based staking vaults
- RWA-backed stablecoin vaults
- Blend vaults with managed leverage
- Cross-chain yield strategies

Everything is **modular**, and easy to integrate across DeFi and the broader EDU ecosystem.
